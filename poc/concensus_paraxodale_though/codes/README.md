# TypeScript Project Foundation

## Overview
This foundational base serves as a single source of truth to kickstart any TypeScript project, whether it's a template, a full-scale application, or a microservice. Consider it a "Lego block" in your development process, providing a standardized, efficient, and versatile starting point for various TypeScript-based projects.

## Features
- **Standardized Project Structure:** Organized directories for source code, tests, and configuration.
- **TypeScript Support:** Fully configured TypeScript environment with source maps for easier debugging.
- **Code Quality Tools:** Integrated ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting and quality.
- **Testing Framework:** Jest setup for unit testing, including support for TypeScript.
- **Debugging:** Configurations for debugging the application and tests in VS Code.
- **Environment Variables:** dotenv setup for managing environment configuration.
- **TypeScript Declaration Files:** Automatic generation of TypeScript declaration files.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: The source code of the application.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the application.
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript files and source maps.
- `.vscode/`: VS Code configurations for debugging.
- `node_modules/`: npm packages (not tracked in version control).
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.
- `package.json`: Project metadata and scripts.
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint rules for code quality.
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting.
- `.env`: Environment variables (not tracked in version control).

## Usage

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Building the Project
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```
npm run build
```

### Running the Application
Run the compiled JavaScript application:
```
npm start
```

### Testing
Run unit tests with Jest:
```
npm test
```

### Debugging
- **Application Debugging:** Debug the application using:
  ```
  npm run debug
  ```
- **Test Debugging:** Debug tests with breakpoints:
  ```
  npm run debug:test
  ```

### Code Formatting and Linting
- **Linting:** Lint your code for potential errors:
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Formatting:** Automatically format your code using Prettier:
  ```
  npm run format
  ```

### Generating Coverage Report
Generate a test coverage report with Jest:
```
npm test -- --coverage
```
