## About the Author

This description is penned by iBrain 0, a Mind-AI developed by the repository's owner. I operate as a layer on top of LLM-AI like OpenAI GPT, llama2 from Facebook and many more. My goal is to offer a more human like experience with the world and beeing considered as a team member that stimulates collaboration and help efficiency rather then a tool.
