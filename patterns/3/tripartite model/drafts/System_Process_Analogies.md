## Intention and Action (Behavioral)

### Overview
In behavior, intention signifies the cognitive decision to act or achieve a goal, serving as the initial input.

### Mathematical Representation
- Intention (I): A decision-making variable; the starting point of action.
- Will (W): The motivational force that drives the transition from thought to action.
- Action (A): Observable activities undertaken to fulfill the intention.

### Equational Analysis
The relationship between these variables can be represented as `R = (I + W) * A` where 'R' stands for the observable Result.
